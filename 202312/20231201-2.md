# MD040/fenced-code-language Fenced code blocks should have a language specified [Context: "```"]
<div style="text-align: right"> December 01, 2023 </div>

## Problem
Error popped out on Github Super Linter CI

## Analysis
Identified issue: Code block (in between triple back ticks - single tick representing backtick -):
```
'''
code block
'''
```
should be identified, in what language it's all about

## Implementation
Every triple backticks for a code block must immediately followed by the code language, e.g: (single tick representing backtick)
```
'''Javascript
// something
'''
```
or
```
'''json
{}
'''
```

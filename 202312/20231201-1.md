# Jasmine Karma How to Show Lines Coverage in Unit Tests
<div style="text-align: right"> December 01, 2023 </div>

## Problem
* Jasmine karma how to show lines coverage?
* Is there a way to show where missed coverage is on karma coverage?

I have an Angular app and I'm giving testing a go but it's a nightmare to find where the coverage is needed.

the output shows the following:
```
=============================== Coverage summary ===============================      
Statements   : 91.67% ( 22/24 )
Branches     : 75% ( 3/4 )
Functions    : 75% ( 3/4 )
Lines        : 90.48% ( 19/21 )
================================================================================ 
```
Is there a way to see where these statements, branches, functions and lines are that are not covered?

e.g. some output that says
```
Statements:
1. file: some/file/name.js line:03
2. file: some/file/name.js line:06
```
Is that possible?

## Analysis
Angular CLI creates code coverage reports when using the following command (see Enable code coverage reports).
```
ng test --code-coverage
```
When the tests are complete, the command creates a new `/coverage` folder in the project or it overwrites its content if it existed before. Open the `index.html` file inside the `/coverage` folder to see a report with your source code and code coverage values.

## Implementation
Added a script in `package.json` to automate the process, i.e:
```
// package.json

  "scripts": {
    ...
    "test:view:coverage": "open ./coverage/myAppName/index.html",
    ...
  },
```
so that whenever I ran `npm run test:view:coverage` it will open the html page to view it.

# Proper Use of `e.g` to Represent `For Example` Abbreviation in Web Development
<div style="text-align: right"> November 26, 2023 </div>

## Note
Found out today when I checked accessibility performance of my web application code.
If we turned on Voice Over, an `e.g` will be announced by Voice Over to the user as `For Example`, but if it is `e.g.` (with a dot suffix), the Voice Over will announce it as `ee gee` instead of `For Example`.

To conclude, we have to use `e.g` as the proper text to represent `for example` in giving an example to users.

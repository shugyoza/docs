# Working with Private Method in Typescript Unit Testing
<div style="text-align: right"> November 20, 2023 </div>

## Performing .spyOn
* When we want to `.spyOn` and mock on a private method, we have to re-type the class that has the private method `as any`, e.g.: (working with private method `comparePassword` within the class `AuthService`)
```
  describe('validateAccount', () => {
    it('should do something', async () => {
      const login = {
        username: 'blabla123',
        password: 'Passwordbla111!',
      };

      jest.spyOn(authService as any, 'comparePassword').mockResolvedValue(true);

      const result = await authService.validateAccount(login);

      expect(result?.id).toBeTruthy();
    });
```

## Invocation
* If we want to call the private method during unit testing, we must use [bracket] notation instead of .dot notation, e.g.: 
```
const result = await authService['comparePassword']
```

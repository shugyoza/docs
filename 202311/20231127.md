# How to Use Angular trackBy
<div style="text-align: right"> November 27, 2023 </div>

## Note
It is used by providing a callback that maps each index to each object's property displayed on that index, e.g:

```
@Component({
  selector: 'my-app',
  template: `
   <li *ngFor="let item of list; trackBy:identify">{{item.name}}</li>
  `
})
export class App {
  list:[];

  identify(index, item){
     return item.name; 
  }
```

Ref: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42108217/how-to-use-trackby-with-ngfor

On each ngDoCheck triggered for the ngForOf directive, Angular checks what objects have changed. It uses differs for this process and each differ uses the trackBy function to compare the current object with the new one. The default trackBy function tracks items by identity:

const identify = (index: number, item: any) => item;
It receives the current item and should return some value. Then the value returned by the function is compared against the value this function returned the last time. If the value changes, the differ reports a change. So if the default function returns object references, it will not match the current item if the object reference has changed. So you can provide your custom trackBy function that will return something else. For example, some key value of the object. If this key value matches the previous one, then Angular will not detect the change.

The syntax ...trackBy:userByName is no longer supported. You must now provide a function reference. ...

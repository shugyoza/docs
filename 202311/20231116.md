# Allowing Different HOST Headers to be Used in ng serve
<div style="text-align: right"> November 16, 2023 </div>

## Problem:
I want to be able to view my developed Angular application ng-served on one of my local machine (macOS machine A) from my other machine (macOS machine B). They both are within the same local network.
So, when I typed `http://myMachineName.local:4200` on my machine B's browser address, the browser would serve the application the same way I could view it on my machine A when I typed `http://localhost:4200` on machine A instead of getting error:
```
invalid host header
```

## Analysis:
Can be observed here: https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/6349 . Essentially by default webpack prevent it to happen. Thus, there should be a manual override on such setting.

## Implementation:
Adding `--host 0.0.0.0` and `--disable-host-check` to `ng serve`, i.e.:
```
// package.json
...
  "scripts": {
    ...
    "start": "ng serve",
    "dev": "ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check",
    ...
  }
...
```
Now I could just do `npm run dev` on my machine A so that I could view it on machine B.
Note: Should only be implemented for dev works only. Not for production.

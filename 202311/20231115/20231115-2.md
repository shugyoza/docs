# Passing Attributes Object into `@Column` Decorator is Better Than Having Multiple Decorators Applied To A Model's Property When Utilizing Sequelize as ORM on a Nestjs app
<div style="text-align: right"> November 15, 2023 </div>

## Problem:
Implementing multiple decorators to a Model/Entity's property name is problematic because now we cannot have a single source of truth to refer to for both regular process AND migration process. This is especially true in working with Sequelize that is currently not typescript friendly with Nestjs, which is a ts framework.

## Analysis:
Referring to the sequelize documentation that: 
* all attribute options from sequelize are valid as props of object arg passed to column, and
* migration process is completely not relevant to nestjs app.

## Implementation:
So having:
```
// attributes object passed into @Column decorator
  @Column({
    allowNull: false,
    autoIncrement: true,
    unique: true,
    primaryKey: true, // like this
    type: DataType.STRING
  })
  propertyName: string
```
is preferable than implementing this:
```
// adding attributes decorators
  @AllowNull(false)
  @AutoIncrement
  @Unique
  @PrimaryKey // like this
  @Column(DataType.INTEGER)
  propertyName: number
```
simply because now we can pull that attributes object out into a single constant file that can be imported to both files for migration and for deployment.

# [ExceptionHandler] A column called 'id' was added to the attributes of 'Users' but not marked with 'primaryKey: true'
<div style="text-align: right"> November 15, 2023 </div>


## Problem:
```
...ERROR [ExceptionHandler] A column called 'id' was added to the attributes of 'Users' but not marked with 'primaryKey: true'
  Error: A column called 'id' was added to the attributes of 'Users' but not marked with 'primaryKey: true' ...
```

## Analysis:
- `id` is a 'special' word in sequelize as it presumes it to be primary key. Thus, if we want to add `id` as a property in our document, it must be given `primaryKey` attribute.
- The way to assign `primaryKey` attribute could be done by either adding a `@PrimaryKey` decorator to the property, or adding a `primaryKey` property within the attributes object passed as an argument into the `@Column` decorator. Examples:
```
// adding @PrimaryKey decorator
  @AllowNull(false)
  @AutoIncrement
  @Unique
  @PrimaryKey // like this
  @Column(DataType.INTEGER)
  id: number
```
OR
```
// adding primaryKey: true
  @Column({
    allowNull: false,
    autoIncrement: true,
    unique: true,
    primaryKey: true, // like this
    type: DataType.INTEGER
  })
  id: number
```

## Implementation:
- Ended up not using `id` at all, and instead to implement more explicit propertyName to represent `id`, e.g.: `userId`, `bookId`.

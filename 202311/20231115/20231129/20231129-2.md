## Problem
What Fields to Include in Register / Sign Up Page?

## Analysis
As we want to impose validator on the username registration, there would likely be a case where User's input for their username got rejected, either because the format is invalid, or the username has been registered by someone else.

When rejections / error get frequent, there's a risk that User would bail and not continue at all with the registration, close the browser and abandon it at all. This would lower client acquisition rate.

So omitting username from registration page would increase client registration rate. Whether user has difficulty when updating their username now more likely became a user retention issue.

## Implementation
We're going to only have three fields in the register/sign-up page: email, password, and confirmPassword. We'd automatically create a default username for the User, which they could update later on in their profile settings.

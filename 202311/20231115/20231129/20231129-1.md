# Property 'replace' does not exist on type 'FormControl<string | null>'.ts(2339)
<div style="text-align: right"> November 29, 2023 </div>

## Problem
Getting a compile error when trying to perform some operational on one of the FormControl's value, as in the title.

Problem happened when we are trying to access the the FormControl property as follows:
```
@Component({...})
export class Something {
  public email = new FormControl('', [required]);

  public onSubmit(): void {
    const email: string = this.email
  }
}
```

## Analysis
On declaration the FormControl has not been given an explicit type at all, i.e:
```
    public email = new FormControl('', [required]);
```
thus .ts by default gave its own type: `FormControl<string|null>`. Null is a default value, and string added on top of it as it is inferred from the given initial value (an empty string '').

Ref: https://github.com/angular/angular/issues/49841#issuecomment-1508295909

But explicitly adding the type to the FormControl did not solve the problem. Further probing, found out that we have to use the getter and setter to work with FormControl properties, e.g:
```
email = this.email.value || '' // getter, with a short-circuit to handle falsy value
this.email.setValue('something') // setter
```

## Implementation
Add explicit type to the FormControl, and implement getter to get value, i.e:
```
@Component({...})
export class Something {
  public email = new FormControl<string | null>('', [required]);

  public onSubmit(): void {
    const email: string = this.email.value || ''
  }
}
```
